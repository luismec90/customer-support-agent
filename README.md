# AI-Powered Customer Support Agent (Dial-in)

This project demonstrates how to create a voice chatbot that can receive phone calls and handle customer requests.

## How It Works

1. Daily receives an incoming call to your phone number.
2. Daily calls your webhook server (`/start` endpoint).
3. The server creates a Daily room with dial-in capabilities.
4. The server starts the bot process with the room details.
5. The caller is put on hold with music.
6. The bot joins the Daily room and signals readiness.
7. Daily forwards the call to the Daily room.
8. The caller and the bot are connected, and the bot handles the conversation.

## Prerequisites

- Pipecat account
- An OpenAI API key for the bot's intelligence
- A Cartesia API key for text-to-speech

---

# Instructions

Let's divide this process into two major sections.

1. Bot setup
2. Server setup

## 1. Bot setup

The following steps walk you through packaging and deploying the bot as a managed container on [Pipecat Cloud](https://pipecat.daily.co/).

### 1. Set up your Python environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the Pipecat Cloud CLI
pip install pipecatcloud
```

### 2. Authenticate with Pipecat Cloud

```bash
pcc auth login
```

### 3. Acquire required API keys

This starter requires the following API keys:

- **Daily and Pipecat API Keys**: Get from [https://pipecat.daily.co/your-organization-name/settings/general](https://pipecat.daily.co)
- **OpenAI API Key**: Get from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Cartesia API Key**: Get from [play.cartesia.ai/keys](https://play.cartesia.ai/keys)

### 4. Set API keys

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env to add your API keys:

# For bot.py
# DAILY_API_KEY=
# DAILY_API_URL=
# OPENAI_API_KEY=
# CARTESIA_API_KEY=

# For server.py
# PIPECAT_API_KEY=
# PIPECAT_SERVICE=
```

**Create a secret set from your .env file**:

```bash
pcc secrets set customer-support-agent-secrets --file .env
```

### 5. Building and Deploying

For detailed instructions on building, deploying, and running your agent, please refer to the [Pipecat Cloud documentation](https://docs.pipecat.daily.co/quickstart).

1. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```shell
   docker build --platform=linux/arm64 -t customer-support-agent:latest .
   ```

2. **Push to a container registry**:

   ```shell
   docker tag customer-support-agent:latest your-repository/customer-support-agent:latest
   docker push your-repository/customer-support-agent:latest
   ```

3. **Deploy to Pipecat Cloud**:

   ```shell
   pcc deploy customer-support-agent your-repository/customer-support-agent:latest --secrets customer-support-agent-secrets
   ```

## Server Setup

### 1. Run the server

‚ö†Ô∏è **Public hosting required**

Daily.co must be able to reach the `/start` webhook exposed by `server.py`. For production you therefore need to run this script on a publicly-reachable server. Any host that can run long-lived Python processes will do such as [render.com](https://render.com/)

#### For local testing, use ngrok to expose your local server

```bash
python server.py
ngrok http 7860
# Then use the provided URL in the next step (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io/start)
```

### 2. Buy a phone number

1. Go to https://pipecat.daily.co/{your-organization-name}/settings/telephony and buy a phone number

2. Set up the webhook that Daily should reach for incoming calls

## Testing

Call the purchased phone number. The system should answer the call, put you on hold briefly, then connect you with the bot.
